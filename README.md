this project for intrusion detection specially rare attack in SDN using AdaBoost + cost-sensitive
the vector of weights is optimized using Grid seaarch and Genetic algorithm to achieve the higheest G-mean which is consideres as the objective function.

this project is devided into two part : using CIC-ids-2017 dataset & the other part using CIC-ids-2018
sarting with concatenating all data set files into 1 single file
data preprocessing
hyper-parameter optimatization
AdaBoost
comparing this algorithm with others
